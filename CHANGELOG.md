# Changelog

> Product overview lives in `PRODUCT.md`. This file tracks recent release history.

## v0.179 - 2026-05-09
**Release SSH auth hardening**
**Deploy / Release Guard:**
- Forced password-based Paramiko deployment connections to skip local SSH key and agent probing, fixing staging/prod deploy attempts that could fail or hang before uploading artifacts even when `SERVER_PASSWORD` was valid.
- Explicitly sends EOF on streamed SSH artifact uploads after closing stdin, so remote `cat > /tmp/*.tar.gz` commands exit cleanly after reaching 100% upload.
- Applied the same password-only auth behavior to API deploy, frontend deploy via the shared SSH helper, release-ready marking, deployment-state updates, prod promotion readiness reads, and dual-env initialization.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added regression coverage for password-only SSH connect parameters and reran the release/deploy Python test slice.

## v0.178 - 2026-05-09
**Distribution operator happy path polish**
**Distribution / Campaign Production Loop:**
- Added browser-local recent publish configurations on `/distribute`, letting operators explicitly restore recent Package, asset, account, copy, and publish-option context after refresh without auto-publishing.
- Added latest-batch next actions so operators can review the current batch summary or jump directly to publish history after a publish attempt.
- Added compatible GeeLark publish-history status/platform/search pagination and CSV export support while preserving the default `items/history` response shape.
- Added clearer publish failure guidance while keeping the raw provider/preflight error visible for debugging.
- Continued low-risk `TabDistribute` extraction through deterministic Distribution view-model helpers, keeping state ownership and GeeLark publish payloads unchanged.
- Extended Campaign Studio video writeback so linked Output Plan items retain generated Studio asset ids and distribution package ids after refresh.
- Added a guarded GeeLark real-publish verifier script that defaults to dry-run and refuses live posting unless an operator supplies account/material/caption plus `--confirm REAL_GEELARK_POST`.
- Added the legacy-surface audit for `sj-ui`, RiskSentiment/TiktokMatrix, and Platform routes without deleting runtime surfaces.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added recent-context, Distribution view-model, publish-step, Campaign Studio package/output-plan, and backend output-plan persistence coverage; reran targeted frontend/backend tests and TypeScript checks.

## v0.177 - 2026-05-09
**Distribution Center readiness navigation**
**Distribution / Operator Flow:**
- Added a compact four-step readiness overview above `/distribute`'s operator sections so marketers can see asset, copy, account, and publish readiness before scrolling.
- Added stable jump anchors for the asset, video/copy, target accounts, and preflight/publish sections without converting the page into a forced wizard.
- Kept readiness derived from existing preflight and publish state, preserving Campaign Package intake, caption generation, account selection, GeeLark publish submission, latest batch tracking, and publish history behavior.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added focused nav render/source coverage, reran targeted distribution tests, frontend production build, backend production build, standard eval, and diff hygiene checks.

## v0.176 - 2026-05-09
**Release tooling SSH stream follow-up**
**Deploy / Release Guard:**
- Replaced the Paramiko SFTP artifact transfer path with SSH-streamed tarballs written to remote temporary files and extracted by remote `tar`, avoiding the observed SFTP completion hang after 100% upload progress.
- Kept deploy uploads bounded with explicit SSH channel/socket timeouts, visible archive progress logs, deterministic resource cleanup, and non-zero CLI exits on failure.
- Updated prod frontend deployment to promote the already verified staging frontend directory server-side, so prod no longer repeats the slow local-to-cloud frontend upload.
**Tests / Build:**
- Extended deploy API/frontend/deploy-all regression coverage for SSH-streamed uploads and staging-to-prod frontend promotion, then reran the release/deploy Python test suite on Python 3.10.

## v0.175 - 2026-05-09
**Distribution Center step refinement**
**Distribution / Operator Flow:**
- Split `/distribute` into four visible operator sections: asset selection, video/copy, target accounts, and preflight/publish confirmation.
- Extracted `DistributeStepAsset`, `DistributeStepCopy`, `DistributeStepAccounts`, and `DistributeStepPublish` as presentational callback-driven components while keeping package hydration, account loading, caption generation, publish submission, batch polling, and history loading in `TabDistribute`.
- Preserved Campaign Package intake, direct caption hints, account-group quick selection, platform copy cards, latest publish batch tracking, and filtered publish history without touching GeeLark backend routes/services.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added distribution step presence/render coverage, reran targeted distribution tests, frontend production build, backend TypeScript/build-equivalent checks, and local Playwright visual verification for `/distribute`.

## v0.174 - 2026-05-09
**Release tooling hardening**
**Deploy / Release Guard:**
- Replaced Python 3.11-only `datetime.UTC` usage in release/deployment timestamp helpers with Python 3.10-compatible UTC handling, including the dual-env initialization script.
- Hardened `deploy_api.py` with tarball-based API artifact upload streamed through SSH to a remote temporary file before extraction, SSH keepalive, bounded channel/socket timeouts, stdout/stderr draining, non-zero exit-code errors, and deterministic cleanup.
- Hardened `deploy_frontend.py` with the same SSH-streamed tarball upload path, archive upload progress, resource cleanup in `finally`, and non-zero CLI exit behavior on failure.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added deploy frontend regression coverage and extended deploy API tests for tarball creation/extract, SSH-streamed file upload, remote command failures, and remote command timeout closure; reran the release/deploy Python test slice on the default Python 3.10 runtime.

## v0.173 - 2026-05-09
**Campaign Production Loop closeout**
**Campaign / Studio / Distribution:**
- Extended Campaign Output -> Advanced Studio handoff context with stable output-plan, production-item, source-requirement, and optional distribution-package identifiers.
- Preserved Campaign Studio handoff context inside `CreateFlowContext` after router state is consumed, so generation results can still find the originating package.
- Added package-safe Studio result sync: successful Studio videos patch linked Campaign Distribution Packages through existing `assets`, `assetReadiness`, and `review` fields, making them publishable without backend schema changes.
- Updated Result and async Dreamina result links so distribution CTAs preserve `/distribute?package=<id>` when a Campaign package is linked.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added handoff, package-patch, and source-presence tests; corrected the stale Distribution intake test from `formPrefill` to `captionContext`; reran targeted Node tests and frontend/backend TypeScript checks. Full Vite build remains blocked on the local Rollup native optional package signature issue.

## v0.172 - 2026-05-09
**Distribution publish history filters**
**Distribution / GeeLark History:**
- Replaced the inline `/distribute` publish-history list with the reusable `DistributePublishHistory` component.
- Added frontend-only status filters, platform-derived filtering, free-text search, date grouping, filtered-empty copy, and preserved task detail/share-link actions.
- Kept GeeLark publish APIs, task-history API shape, scheduling, pagination, CSV export, and analytics out of scope.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added focused helper/render coverage for history filtering and grouping, then reran the targeted distribution test plus frontend/backend production builds.

## v0.171 - 2026-05-09
**Campaign Output to Advanced Studio bridge**
**Campaign / Studio / Asset Library:**
- Added an "Open in Advanced Studio" handoff for eligible Campaign Output video items, carrying the production prompt, target Studio template, and matched game source asset IDs through React Router state.
- Added a Studio handoff consumer that preselects Quick Single or Character Showcase, seeds the prompt, and safely imports matched Asset Library images as Dreamina multimodal references without touching protected generation services.
- Added a reusable `UnifiedAssetSelector` foundation in Studio so Quick Single, Motion Transfer, and Character Showcase can pull structured reference slots from Asset Library while keeping legacy Drive selection available.
- Added Studio quality prompt presets for Character Showcase subtypes, Motion Transfer direction, and BGM mood hints as prompt guidance only.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added bridge/preset/source-presence tests and reran targeted Node tests plus the frontend production build.

## v0.170 - 2026-05-09
**Distribution Center operator MVP**
**Distribution / Campaign Package / GeeLark Accounts:**
- Removed the duplicate editable Campaign Brief form from `/distribute`; Campaign Package context now appears as a read-only summary that still feeds caption generation.
- Added a lightweight direct-publish caption hint and platform copy cards that show selected-account counts while preserving the existing platform-grouped publish payload.
- Added permission-scoped account group quick selection from `group:` account remarks plus custom localStorage groups, with stale IDs filtered against currently permitted accounts.
- Enriched pending package cards with angle, hook, target platform/market, publishability badges, and missing-asset next actions without changing GeeLark core routes/services.
**Tests / Build:**
- Reran frontend TypeScript checks after the MVP UI changes; full release verification evidence is recorded in the workflow run.

## v0.169 - 2026-05-09
**Advanced Studio template optimization Phase 1**
**Studio / Templates:**
- Reduced the Studio creation picker to three marketer-facing paths: Quick Single, Motion Transfer, and Character Showcase.
- Removed active Short Drama / Cat Harem template configs, fallback presets, and short-drama UI branches while keeping the legacy presets endpoint compatibility-safe with an empty response.
- Hid `cg-trailer` from Studio template APIs and frontend fallback data while retaining its config file for a later Production Wizard promo preset handoff.
- Added Quick Single prompt inspirations plus template-specific duration/aspect choices: Quick Single 4/6/8/10s with 9:16/16:9/1:1, Motion Transfer 5/8/10s, and Character Showcase 9:16/16:9.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added backend template registry and frontend template-option/fallback tests, then reran frontend/backend TypeScript checks and targeted native Node tests.

## v0.168 - 2026-05-09
**Campaign Source Asset readiness**
**Campaign / Output Workbench / Asset Library:**
- Connected Campaign Creative output plans to existing Asset Library records so source-asset requirements can surface matching candidates instead of only showing generic missing-asset states.
- Added row-level source asset actions in Output Workbench: matched asset references, choose-from-library flow, and upload/add routing for missing game source assets.
- Added deterministic selection helpers so confirmed source assets only unblock the production items that require them while text/post outputs remain producible and distribution-safe.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added focused source-readiness and AssetPicker source tests, then reran Campaign Output, Workbench, production adapter, and distribution bridge regressions with Node's native test runner.

## v0.167 - 2026-05-08
**Campaign Output one-click production**
**Campaign / Output Workbench:**
- Streamlined the post-brief Output Workbench primary action so first confirmation produces supported text/post drafts and persists the produced plan in one step.
- Preserved saved-plan idempotency by keeping subsequent confirmations on the update path, so already produced outputs are not duplicated.
- Updated Workbench wiring and bilingual copy to remove the separate save-only step from the default Campaign Mission Control path.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added source-level integration and UI presence assertions for one-click production, then reran output-plan, production-adapter, distribution-bridge tests plus backend and frontend production builds.

## v0.166 - 2026-05-08
**Campaign Output production adapters Phase 2A**
**Campaign / Production / Distribution:**
- Added deterministic Phase 2A production for supported Output Workbench text items: captions, headlines, hashtags, and Facebook posts now produce reviewable draft content after output-plan confirmation.
- Extended `ProductionItem` with validated `producedOutputs` and preserved those drafts through the owner-scoped `/api/campaign-output/plans` API.
- Updated Campaign Creative package creation so produced text outputs feed pending distribution package copy while account selection, media readiness, and final publish remain explicit.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added frontend adapter, UI presence/integration, distribution bridge, and backend persistence tests; reran targeted suites plus backend and frontend production builds.

## v0.165 - 2026-05-08
**Campaign Output Workbench Phase 1**
**Campaign / Distribution / Source Assets:**
- Added deterministic `CampaignOutputPlan` modeling and tests so confirmed briefs produce visible deliverables, concrete game source asset requirements, GOBS production capability statuses, and capability gaps.
- Added backend `/api/campaign-output/plans` create/list/read/update persistence with server-owned user scoping, explicit validation, SQLite indexes, and payload round-trip tests.
- Added the frontend Campaign Output Workbench component, output-plan API helpers, CampaignCreative integration, and bilingual copy so the default post-brief surface leads with planned outputs instead of internal system reasoning.
- Added a distribution bridge from produced output items to pending distribution package drafts while keeping blocked/unsupported items non-publishable and preserving explicit account selection.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added frontend model, UI presence/integration, distribution bridge, and backend API tests; reran targeted suites plus backend and frontend production builds.

## v0.164 - 2026-05-08
**Campaign Output Workbench plan hardening**
**Docs / Product Planning:**
- Incorporated OpenClaw review into the Campaign Output Workbench design with a deterministic Phase 1 mapping table for deliverables, source asset requirements, fallback behavior, and capability-gap creation.
- Split the Phase 1 UI implementation plan into separate component/API and CampaignCreative integration tasks, reducing Builder risk before runtime work starts.
- Expanded required edge-case tests, clarified capability-gap consumption, documented Phase 2-4 follow-up plan boundaries, and verified release-script assumptions in the current repo.

## v0.163 - 2026-05-08
**Campaign Output Workbench planning**
**Docs / Product Planning:**
- Added `docs/plans/2026-05-08-campaign-output-workbench-game-source-assets-design.md`, defining the next Campaign Mission Control step as an output workbench focused on deliverables, game source asset readiness, GOBS production capability, and capability gaps.
- Added `docs/plans/2026-05-08-campaign-output-workbench-game-source-assets-plan.md`, breaking the approved direction into output-plan modeling, backend persistence, frontend workbench UI, distribution-package bridging, tests, run docs, and release sync.
- Updated planning indexes so the current mainline points from the completed Distribution Handoff MVP toward B-stage output workbench execution with a C-stage autopilot path.

## v0.162 - 2026-05-07
**Daily review workflow and report archive**
**Docs / Workflow:**
- Added `.agents/skills/daily-review/` as a repo-local skill for evidence-based daily work recaps using git history, PRODUCT changelog entries, workflow run docs, and prior daily reports.
- Added `docs/daily-reports/2026-05-06.md`, summarizing the 2026-05-06 shipped work, bug-fix ratio, repeated issue clusters, verification rigor, and recommended next-day TODOs.
- Kept this release documentation-only; no runtime Campaign Creative, Distribution handoff, API, or publishing behavior changed.

## v0.160 - 2026-05-07
**Campaign Creative -> Distribution Handoff MVP Builder**
**Campaign / Distribution / Package Persistence:**
- Added backend `Campaign Distribution` package create/list/read/update APIs backed by the existing SQLite asset DB, with server-owned `ownerId/createdBy/updatedBy`, safe review/asset-readiness validation, and ownership seam tests.
- Added a mission-first `Distribution Package` panel to `/campaign-creative`, so confirmed generated briefs plus selected/recommended variants can be saved as pending packages with routed Gold and Glory knowledge context while keeping `Open In Advanced Studio` as the advanced path.
- Added `/distribute` pending-package intake through a package-to-draft adapter and `Pending Packages` panel, including `?package=` hydration, prefilled asset/copy/campaign hints, explicit account-safety messaging, and missing-asset next actions for Asset Library or Quick Film.
- Fixed the login page so isolated worktrees and split-port dev smoke use the same `VITE_API_BASE_URL` as the rest of the app instead of falling back to a mismatched relative auth path.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added focused frontend source/adapter tests plus backend seam tests, added a login auth-base regression test, reran backend/frontend typecheck, reran the frontend build, revalidated `workflow_guard --stage build/verify`, and completed local browser smoke for `/campaign-creative` -> `/distribute?package=<id>`.

## v0.161 - 2026-05-07
**Mission-first brief generation stability**
**Campaign Creative / Gold and Glory Brain:**
- Replaced the raw clipped routed knowledge digest before `POST /api/campaign-creative/mission-brief` with a short per-section summary digest, and tightened the LLM request to single-line JSON with a lower-variance temperature, keeping the prompt compact enough that large ready-pack sets no longer truncate the reply and force a noisy deterministic fallback in the default Campaign Creative path.
- Preserved the backend-routed knowledge model and full returned `knowledgeContext`; only the LLM-facing digest was compacted, so downstream System Plan / Variant Pack / Distribution Package consumers still receive the same routed context fields.
**Tests / Build:**
- Added a focused backend regression test for verbose routed context, reran the backend mission-brief suite, and revalidated the fix against the real 8-pack routed staging and prod contexts before release sync.

## v0.159 - 2026-05-07
**Campaign distribution handoff mission-first alignment**
**Docs / Product Planning:**
- Aligned the Campaign Creative -> Distribution Handoff MVP design with the released `a94a7f5` mission-first Campaign Creative baseline: mission, generated brief review, System Plan / Variant Pack, then Distribution Package.
- Updated the package contract and planner-spec so pending distribution packages preserve mission/brief snapshot, generation source, warnings, selected/recommended variant, and backend-routed Gold and Glory knowledge context.
- Added guardrails that forbid reintroducing marketer-facing Knowledge Brain pack selection, multi-project brain selection, or the old expert brief form into the default Campaign Creative path.

## v0.158 - 2026-05-07
**Campaign Mission Control mission-first autopilot**
**Campaign Creative / Gold and Glory Brain:**
- Added `POST /api/campaign-creative/mission-brief` so the backend automatically routes ready Gold and Glory knowledge packs, derives context, generates a structured brief with Compass, and falls back deterministically when LLM generation is unavailable.
- Rebuilt `/campaign-creative` around a mission composer and generated brief review, removing marketer-facing knowledge-pack selection and full blank-brief entry from the default path.
- Preserved the existing System Plan, Variant Pack, and Advanced Studio handoff contracts after brief confirmation, with targeted tests for backend generation, frontend API wiring, and default selector removal.

## v0.157 - 2026-05-07
**Campaign distribution implementation guardrails**
**Docs / Product Planning:**
- Clarified that Campaign Distribution packages should use the existing `assetDb.ts` better-sqlite3 database with a `campaign_distribution_packages` table, indexed owner/status/time columns, and `payload_json` for the full package body.
- Added a `TabDistribute` integration budget: if direct package intake requires broad publish/account rewiring, Builder should split to a smaller Pending Packages entry/panel instead of risking the existing distribution flow.
- Added `needs_asset` next-action guidance and creation-confirmation requirements so missing-asset packages lead operators toward asset-library selection, Quick Film generation, or Editor fine-tuning instead of a dead-end draft.

## v0.156 - 2026-05-07
**Campaign distribution handoff planning guardrails**
**Docs / Product Planning:**
- Tightened the CampaignDistributionPackage design with server-owned `ownerId`, `createdBy`, and `updatedBy` fields, plus current-user filtering requirements for package list/read/update APIs.
- Added explicit asset readiness rules so `needs_asset` is package asset state, not review status, and publishable packages require a server-resolvable path, verified URL, or backend-resolvable gallery asset.
- Expanded the planner-spec with a package-to-distribution-draft adapter, ownership tests, asset-readiness tests, and deterministic Distribution intake mapping before Builder starts implementation.

## v0.155 - 2026-05-07
**Campaign Creative to Distribution handoff planning**
**Docs / Product Planning:**
- Added the Campaign Creative -> Distribution Handoff MVP design, aligning OpenClaw's code/product evaluation with the current GOBS north star: knowledge-backed campaign variants should become publish-ready packages instead of forcing marketers through the heavy Editor by default.
- Bootstrapped run `2026-05-07-campaign-to-distribution-handoff-mvp` with a scoped Gate 1 planner-spec covering package data contracts, backend package APIs, Campaign Creative package creation, Distribution intake, safety guardrails, and test expectations.
- Refreshed task and plan indexes so the next active mainline points to the campaign-to-distribution package workflow before Dashboard, navigation IA, scheduling, analytics, or Knowledge -> Memory writeback work.

## v0.154 - 2026-05-07
**Advanced Production English reference UX**
**Advanced Studio / Production Wizard:**
- Fixed English-mode Dreamina multimodal reference UX so reference cards, manual matching controls, context hints, and prompt restore actions follow English UI copy while preserving Dreamina's required `@图片n` protocol tokens.
- Improved English reference injection for names such as `Mexican Gaming Son`, `Mexican Father`, and `Toothbrush Aisle` through unique aliases without stacking multiple tags on shared words.
- Dreamina multimodal enqueue now submits the visible multimodal prompt instead of stale execution segment text, so queued jobs carry the image-reference prompt shown in the panel.

## v0.153 - 2026-05-07
**Documentation hygiene and active-run cleanup**
**Docs / Workflow:**
- Refreshed `docs/TASK-INDEX.md` so the active project entry point reflects the current Gold and Glory Campaign Creative Agent mainline instead of the old April stability backlog.
- Removed duplicate trailing release-note fragments from `PRODUCT.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`, keeping recent history canonical and easier to scan.
- Reclassified `production-english-reference-ux` as Advanced Studio side-lane work after the parallel fix landed, so it remains documented without becoming the current Campaign Creative Agent priority.

## v0.152 - 2026-05-07
**Gold and Glory canonical fastpublish brain**
**Campaign Knowledge / Fastpublish Brain:**
- Added a committed `gold-and-glory-canonical` brain seed derived from curated fastpublishing knowledge across brand tone, compliance, visual style, Malaysia market, persona, live ops calendar, live ops history, and selling-point playbook.
- Backend template import now creates stable persisted source and pack ids for the canonical brain, with original fastpublishing source paths and `sha256` checksums for future refresh/diff runs.
- Frontend brain import now targets the Gold and Glory canonical template instead of the generic `fastpublish-core` demo template, and the Platform Framework action copy now says `GNG Brain` explicitly.
**Tests / Docs:**
- Added targeted backend coverage for repeatable canonical import, wrong-game protection, source metadata, and derived campaign context; added frontend coverage for the default canonical template id; documented the manual fastpublishing -> GOBS refresh workflow.

## v0.151 - 2026-05-07
**Gold and Glory single-brain shell correction**
**Campaign Creative / Knowledge Brain / Platform Memory:**
- Removed the marketer-facing multi-project demo seed from the frontstage platform memory defaults and collapsed the visible brain target to `Gold and Glory` only.
- Reframed the `Knowledge Brain` shell so `/campaign-creative` no longer shows `Project Nova Arena`, `Idle Kingdom Go`, or `Current Game` copy, while keeping the existing knowledge API contract and derivation flow intact.
- Tightened the empty-state, unsupported-state, and fallback copy so the UI stays honest: Gold and Glory is the only supported frontstage brain target, but real fastpublish knowledge content may still be missing and strategy generation can still fall back to brief-only mode.
**Tests:**
- Added single-brain frontstage regression coverage for the stable knowledge id helper and selector shell copy, reran the targeted locale/brain tests, rebuilt the frontend bundle, and revalidated backend typecheck plus workflow guard.

## v0.150 - 2026-05-07
**Advanced Studio phase-1 nav demotion and review-queue emphasis**
**Campaign / Home / Navigation:**
- Moved `/projects` out of the primary `Mission Control` nav group and into `Advanced Studio`, so project-level review work no longer reads like a default campaign entry point.
- Strengthened the Home review queue as the clearer follow-on action with a dedicated `Review Pending Decisions` CTA, while keeping `Campaign Creative` as the primary recommended path.
- Softened the homepage’s Advanced Studio copy so the professional workspace reads as optional follow-on tooling instead of the next expected click.
**Tests:**
- Added locale assertions for the new home/layout review and advanced-entry wording, reran the targeted locale regression suite, rebuilt the frontend bundle, and captured `eval.sh` evidence for the run.

## v0.149 - 2026-05-07
**Advanced Studio phase-0 marketer-first entry demotion**
**Campaign / Studio / Copy Hierarchy:**
- Reframed advanced follow-on entry points so `/campaign-creative` launches `Open In Advanced Studio` as a clearly secondary step instead of reading like the default workflow.
- Updated `/projects` to read as an advanced review workspace with `Review Before Publish` framing while preserving the existing project list, card click behavior, and route targets.
- Added an editor-side `Fine-Tune In Editor` guidance banner so shot-level and subtitle-level controls remain available without competing with the marketer-first Mission Control flow.
**Tests:**
- Added locale assertions for the new advanced-entry labels, reran the targeted locale regression suite, rebuilt the frontend bundle, and captured `eval.sh` evidence for the run.

## v0.148 - 2026-05-07
**Campaign Mission Control phase-0 marketer-first shell**
**Campaign / Mission Control / Handoff:**
- Added shared `campaignProfile`, `campaignPlan`, and optional `feedbackRecords` contracts to the Campaign Creative -> Editor normalization seam so the marketer-facing shell can carry mission-control context without breaking the existing knowledge-aware strategy flow.
- Reframed the homepage and top-level navigation around `Campaign Mission Control`, kept `/campaign-creative` as the recommended entry, and moved deeper editor-style routes under an `Advanced Studio` label instead of leading with tool-first copy.
- Reworked `/campaign-creative` to present campaign brief, selected knowledge, system plan, and pending review decisions ahead of local tuning controls while preserving the existing strategy card, variant pack, and editor launch path.
**Tests:**
- Added mission-control seam and planning regression tests, refreshed locale assertions, and revalidated backend seam tests plus frontend/backend production builds.

## v0.147 - 2026-05-07
**Campaign planning docs and workflow template sync**
**Docs / Workflow / Planning:**
- Added the fastpublish knowledge-integration design and implementation plans to the mainline docs set so the shipped Knowledge Brain work has a durable upstream reference.
- Refreshed the campaign mission-control implementation plan to depend on the landed knowledge-aware creative flow instead of the older brief-only assumption.
- Added a reusable `planner-spec-template.md` and upgraded the run templates so campaign-creative-related runs carry the same north-star and product-shape guardrail by default.
- Cleaned the plans index so the current campaign, mission-control, and knowledge-brain docs resolve to the active workspace paths instead of stale machine-specific links.

## v0.144 - 2026-05-06
**Campaign Creative -> Editor knowledge handoff**
**Editor / Knowledge Context / Memory:**
- Campaign Creative handoff now preserves applied `knowledgePackIds` plus structured knowledge context so EditorWorkbench can restore the same market truth, audience tension, tone rules, visual cues, approved angles, hook candidates, and forbidden claims that were approved on the strategy page.
- Editor apply and apply-stream now normalize that knowledge-aware payload end to end, including brief-only fallback strategy generation, prompt assembly, and memory promotion into stable facts, preference signals, and avoid signals.
- The editor strategy card now shows an applied-knowledge summary so operators can confirm which knowledge packs and constraints the first cut is honoring, while legacy brief-only handoff payloads remain compatible.
**Tests:**
- Added targeted frontend/backend seam tests for knowledge-context normalization, strategy fallback reconstruction, strategy-card rendering, and memory promotion, then revalidated backend typecheck plus frontend/backend production builds.

## v0.142 - 2026-05-06
**Campaign Creative knowledge consumption**
**Frontend / Campaign Creative:**
- Added a Knowledge Brain selector on /campaign-creative so the current game's persisted packs can be selected, refreshed, and applied before strategy generation.
- Upgraded local strategy generation to consume derived campaign knowledge context, enriching strategy cards with market truth, audience tension, tone rules, forbidden claims, visual cues, approved angles, and knowledge-driven hooks while keeping zero-pack fallback intact.
- Reused the same knowledge-aware strategy state for the Variant Pack flow, so regenerated variants stay aligned with the selected knowledge context instead of reverting to brief-only heuristics.
**Tests:**
- Added targeted strategy knowledge tests covering derived-context merge, zero-context fallback, and knowledge-aware variant differentiation, then revalidated the existing campaign strategy and knowledge-brain frontend tests plus production build.

## v0.141 - 2026-05-06
**Marketer-first video distribution workspace foundations**
**Distribution / UX / Prompt Wiring:**
- TabDistribute now starts from a selected asset workspace instead of relying on fresh Studio-only state, and users can pick from current flow, local gallery, or recent server outputs before publishing.
- Account selection is now explicit, per-platform drafts are visible and editable, and the page surfaces campaign framing inputs plus existing publish options like markAI and 
eedShareLink.
- /api/geelark/tasks now returns normalized publish history alongside compatible raw items, and /api/prompt/generate-caption accepts optional campaignContext fields without new env vars.
- Added targeted frontend/backend regression tests plus a P2 scheduling design spike document, while keeping runtime scheduling and approval flow out of scope for this slice.

## v0.140 - 2026-05-06
**English localization hardening for language presets, editor API errors, and export overview**
**i18n / Editor / Production Wizard:**
- UI/content language switching now supports explicit preset combinations instead of forcing both layers to move together.
- Login and editor-side direct fetch flows now pass locale headers and return localized fallback errors instead of hardcoded Chinese strings.
- Storyboard export overview now uses message keys and locale-aware date formatting end to end.
## v0.139 - 2026-05-06
**Campaign Knowledge Brain foundation**
**Campaign / Knowledge Brain:**
- Added resolver-managed campaign knowledge storage plus new list, template import, source creation, and derive-context APIs so GOBS can persist reusable creative knowledge per game instead of relying on mock-only state.
- Added a first `fastpublish`-inspired template pack set covering tone, compliance, visual style, market fundamentals, persona, live ops, and selling-point playbooks, together with structured context derivation for downstream Campaign Creative and Editor use.
- Reworked the Platform Framework Knowledge Brain block to load real persisted knowledge packs, expose a one-click recommended import action, and clearly gate persistence to stable seeded game ids for this foundation slice.
**Tests:**
- Added targeted backend tests for knowledge storage/import/derivation and frontend tests for Knowledge Brain API wiring/rendering, then revalidated with backend typecheck plus frontend/backend production builds.

## v0.137 - 2026-05-06
**Production Wizard shot success-state reconciliation**
**Advanced Production / Storyboard:**
- Shot strip and aggregate shot status now prefer any playable preview video result over a later failed retry, so recovered shots stay marked as completed.
- Execution-segment aggregate status now treats existing shot-level or segment-level preview media as a successful provider result before surfacing stored failed states.
- Added a regression test covering the case where a shot keeps a playable version while a newer execution attempt fails.
## v0.134 - 2026-05-06
**Repo-local slash entry for the guarded GOBS multi-agent workflow**
**Internal / Dev Workflow:**
- Added repo-local plugin plugins/gobs-loop plus .agents/plugins/marketplace.json so compatible clients can expose a slash-style /gobs-loop entry.
- Added plugins/gobs-loop/skills/gobs-loop-entry/SKILL.md as a thin wrapper that routes slash invocation back into the canonical repo skill gobs-multi-agent-dev-loop.
- Updated the core workflow skill metadata and invocation docs so /gobs-loop and $gobs-multi-agent-dev-loop are documented together, with the explicit skill call kept as the portable fallback.
## v0.133 - 2026-05-06
**Portable slash-invokable packaging for the repo multi-agent workflow skill**
**Internal / Dev Workflow:**
- Packaged `gobs-multi-agent-dev-loop` as a repo-local skill with valid frontmatter, `agents/openai.yaml`, and explicit `$gobs-multi-agent-dev-loop` invocation metadata.
- Added `references/invocation.md` and `references/workflow-map.md` so the skill has a clear structure and portable repo-relative guidance after `git clone` or `git pull` on another computer.
- Removed machine-specific absolute path assumptions from the skill body and related references, keeping cross-computer use repo-relative.
- Revalidated the packaged skill after the slash/invocation packaging update.

## v0.132 - 2026-05-02
**Repo-local multi-agent self-loop workflow guardrails**
**Internal / Dev Workflow:**
- Added repo-private skill `gobs-multi-agent-dev-loop` for lower-touch multi-agent delivery.
- Added `scripts/init_workflow_run.py` to create a full 4+1 run folder with `SESSION-ANCHOR.md`.
- Added `scripts/workflow_guard.py` plus `scripts/workflow_common.py` to enforce forbidden-file boundaries, editable scope ownership, stage artifact readiness, and `PRODUCT.md` updates before verify/release.
- Added unit tests for workflow bootstrap and guard behavior, plus root npm shortcuts `workflow:init` and `workflow:guard`.
- Refreshed workflow docs, contracts, prompts, and templates so the loop is repo-local and repeatable.

## v0.131 - 2026-04-24
**Legacy path fallbacks for dual-env shared-data layout**
**Backend / Compatibility:**
- Editor projects now resolve from shared-data first and can rehome legacy files from old api/editor-projects paths.
- Output gallery scanning and file serving now fall back to legacy api/output paths when shared-data output is empty.
- GeeLark account config loaders now also check ../../config/geelark-accounts.json for split staging/prod layouts.
- Imagen runtime script resolution now supports repo-root scripts/imagen_generate.py in deployed prod/api and staging/api layouts.
- init_dual_env_server now copies legacy output, editor-projects, uploads, db, exports, assets and .data content into each env shared-data directory.
**Tests:**
- Added targeted fallback tests for editor project storage, output gallery legacy paths, GeeLark config path fallback, Imagen script path fallback and dual-env init migration commands.

## v0.130 — 2026-04-24

**高级制片 execution segment 执行层上线**

**Advanced Production / Execution Segments:**
- 保留原始 shots[] 作为叙事分镜主视图，同时新增 executionSegments[] 作为即梦执行层；<4s 的连续短镜会自动合并，>15s 的长镜会自动拆分。
- atch-jobs 与项目持久化支持 segmentId / sourceShotIndexes / primaryShotIndex，成片、失败、取消会优先回写到对应 execution segment，再聚合回原始 shot。
- 高级制片分镜条、工作区与导出页切到 segment-aware 聚合状态，原始 storyboard 仍按 shot 浏览，但状态、完成度、执行分段面板和导出统计都会按 execution segment 聚合展示。
- 补充前后端回归测试：覆盖 execution segment 解析、保存时合并保护、短镜合并、长镜拆分，以及 enqueue 假成功状态判定。
